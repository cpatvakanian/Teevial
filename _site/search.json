    "text": "In January 2025, Teevial conducted a pilot project at Gyulagarak High School in Lori, Armenia, to assess youth perceptions of water cleanliness and environmental issues in their community. This initiative aimed to collect data on local water quality perceptions, introduce students to data-driven problem-solving, and align with Teevial’s mission of engaging rural youth in evidence-based community improvement.\n\n\n\n\nThe survey included 47 students from grades 9-12, primarily from Gyulagarak, with a few participants from nearby villages. The sample size provided a strong representation of the school’s student population.\n\n\n\nMost students (80.9%) reported having access to piped water at home, with a majority perceiving their drinking water as safe. Among those who treated their water, 42% relied on boiling. Over the past five years, 68% of students believed water quality remained stable, while 25% thought it had improved.\n\n\n\nThe Dzoraget River was the most frequently encountered natural water source. The majority (68.1%) perceived natural water as acceptable in quality, with 70.2% believing its cleanliness had remained consistent or improved over time.\n\n\n\nStudents highlighted environmental issues, limited access to quality education, and rural stereotypes as primary concerns. Youth advocacy interest was strong, with 60% expressing a desire for continued engagement with Teevial."

    "text": "The students who were surveyed in the high school ranged from grades 9-12, and their age spanned from 14 to 18 years old.\nMost all participants were from Gyulagarak, with the exception of 2 students that commuted from the nearby villages of Pushkino and Hobartsi.\nThe total sample size of participants was 47 out of roughly 60 students who were in the target age/grade range for our pilot project. With this group, we’re about 80% sure that our results are accurate within 5% of what we would find if every eligible student had participated. For the purpose of a pilot project, we found this sample to be sufficient for our initial exploratory objective to have a rough understanding of the youth’s perception and sentiment on water quality."
