## Demographic Data

The students who were surveyed in the high school ranged from grades 9-12, and their age spanned from 14 to 18 years old.



Most all participants were from Gyulagarak, with the exception of 2 students that commuted from the nearby villages of Pushkino and Hobartsi. 



The total sample size of participants was 47 out of roughly 60 students who were in the target age/grade range for our pilot project. With this group, we’re about 80% sure that our results are accurate within 5% of what we would find if every eligible student had participated. For the purpose of a pilot project, we found this sample to be sufficient for our initial exploratory objective to have a rough understanding of the youth’s perception and sentiment on water quality.
