## Water in The Home

The survey showed that most students (80.9%) do have access to piped water at home, and the majority did not apply any treatment to make that water safe. For those that did use treatments, 42% reported the primary method was boiling.


Over the course of the past 5 years, 68% of students thought the cleanliness of drinking water had stayed the same and 25% reported that it improved. As a whole, the overwhelming majority of students had a positive perception of their home water quality and safety, which is a positive sign.
